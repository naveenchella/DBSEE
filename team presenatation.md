 <p><b> Team Motivation: </b></p>  <br />
 In Software engineering field learning programming doesn't help you in the real time projects. So you need to know how the real time project goes, since in this course “Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers ", we are developing an android app called Bird Tracking, it describes that every birdwatcher has unique knowledge and experience. Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to alerts that let you know when species have been seen. We strive to provide the most current and useful information to the birding community.
 As we use apps in smart phones daily, creating your own app and used by people which is very exciting for us to develop app.
 Another Interesting point is exploring new technologies like GitHub, Zen hub, Android Fundamentals. Which are currently using in a wide range of companies.
<br />
<br />
 <p><b> Complementary Skills: </b></p>
 Our team is adoptable to learning new skills, taking on extra responsibilities. We are Critical Thinkers, it involves evaluating facts before reaching a conclusion. It helps an app developer to write clean and maintainable code.
 <br />
 <p><b> Roles and Responisibilities </b></p>
 Without perfect position and specific individual task, it will be difficult to know what exactly has to be done to achieve the output. So, we defined our roles and responsibilities in an effective way to meet the customer requirements.

 Rather than moving up in one direction, we will be able to exchange our 	responsibilities as follows;  <br />
 NARENDRA and THIRUPATHI will be taking care of the Design and 	implementation part. <br />
 PRAVEEN will be taking care of Requirement analysis and Blog 	Maintenance.  <br />
 KAMALHASAN will be working on Testing Design, Task Management and Documentation.
 <br />
 <br />
 <p><b> Team Communication </b></p>
 We have two fixed meetings in every week to discuss our individual tasks and to check the progress of our work, and once with the customer to know the modified requirements. As we live in neighbour houses, we can be in touch with all the team anytime and we also using social media apps to stay in connect with team like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger Team viewer etc..
