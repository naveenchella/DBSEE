 <p><b> REQUIREMENTS </b></p> 
                 Welcome to our second blog. We have been working on requirement analysis of Bird Tracking mobile application for few weeks.  In this blog we will provide the complete information about how the tasks are classified and approached them on the basis of schedule.
   <br />
 <p><b> Task I - Gathering requirements: </b></p>
 
 Our team gathered to set bunch of questions in front of customer. We met him on given appointment of time to discuss our queries. At the end of meeting we came up with fallowing requirements.

 <p><b> Task II- Analyzing requirements: </b></p>  <br />
In regular meetings with group members and customer, we categorized requirements into 3 types named as Essential, Necessaries and Desirable.

 <p><b> Task III - A) Mapping requirements to user stories: </b></p>
After customer interaction, our team evaluated which steps have the most benefit for the user, and prioritize what should be built next. By considering   few aspects in the user´s perspective, we mapped requirements to user stories.
 <br />
 <p><b> B) Specifying requirements / Use case diagram: </b></p>
 From the above tasks I, II &III we finalized requirements by considering few factors ( like  how much time do we have, what customer requires , how much possible to deign and implement the application etc..). Finally after getting confirmation from client, we specified requirements in the form of fallowing use case diagram.
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <p><b> Task IV-  Wrong Assumptions: </b></p>
 Before going to meet customer our team  assumed this app can track movement of the birds including food habits, sleeping time etc. with help of Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology or satellites. However, when we met customer he explained this requirement is out of scope and more complex even though interesting. 
Adding more, Initially  we thought about tracking of bird only with already existing data in wiki to GPS. But later we understood that,the data should be tracked by user and entering the same in our APP.

 <p><b> Task V- Managing tasks: </b></p>
